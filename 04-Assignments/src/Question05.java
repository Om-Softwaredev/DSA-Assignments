ðŸ’¡ You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer n, return *the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
